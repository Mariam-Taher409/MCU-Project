#Creating a testbench for MCU Project
Deliverables
• A complete testbench that covers all possible uses for the MCU.
• Tasks for each operation to increase testing and readability.
• Functions that are used to calculate the expected correct output to be compared to the DUT
output.
• A test scenario that utilizes all the mentioned tasks and functions that goes over all the
operations and tries them 2-3 different inputs.
