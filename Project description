# MCU-Project
Designing a Microprocessor that can do the following operations
• Add, subtract, multiply, divide, AND, OR, XOR
• The operands will be given as memory locations
• The output will be dumped in a memory location specified by input
• Contains a parameterizable memory
• Both width and size of the memory can be parameterized
• The size of the memory will be given as the required number of bits
• Read a value from memory and write it to output
• Write a value directly to a memory location
• Gives 1 on an output pin when given an invalid operation code
